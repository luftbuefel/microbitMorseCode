# morseCodeMicrobit
This allows multiple Microbits to communicate by way of Morse Code. The left button is a dot and the right button is a dash. Flip the Microbit to trigger a "screen down" event to signify the end of a letter. Once you have written your message, press the a and b buttons at the same time to send your message. The message is transmitted via Bluetooth to surrounding Microbits where it is decoded into English letters.
